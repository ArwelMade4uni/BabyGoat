    <h1> Congratulations! </h1> 
    <h2> You've preformed an IDOR exploit </h2>
    <p>
    While a simple version of the exploit, it was made simple to demonstrate how quickly and simpily<br> this exploit can be preformed if a website hasn't been properly configured against these attacks.<br> For example, if a website doesn't correctly encript the URL or set it so the user cant see the full URL <br> the security of that website is gone.<br><br>
    That's how easily a website could be exploited and have potencial secret files or private webpages <br>can be discovered. If you want to learn how IDOR attacks can be prevented, please continue reading.

    <h3> Prevention Techniques </h3>
    <p>
    To prevent the method just preformed you can use encrypted webpage names or use a random collection<br>of letters and words. While it does make development harder, it can help prevent attackers finding items<br>on the website. An access control check where several checks are done to make sure the request sent is<br>genuine and not one that has been tampered with.
